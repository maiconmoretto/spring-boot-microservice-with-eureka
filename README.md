# spring-boot-microservice-with-eureka
<br>this project uses Ribbon to make the load balance,
<br>eureka config server to keep the configs,
<br>and the eureka server to get the id of each application,

That Client Side Load Balancing (CSLB) is the HTTP client that decides which microservice receives the request
This is important, as you can have several options of the same service on the air
The configuration of the CSLB is made from the @LoadBalanced annotation, in the creation of the RestTemplate
How to implement CSLB, honoring a project called Ribbon, which is part of the Spring Cloud Netflix
To find out which customers exist, we can inject a DiscoveryClient interface
As an alternative to RestTemplate, we can use Spring Feign, which already uses the Ribbon for CSLB
Spring Feign requires only one interface, with the definition and mapping of the methods that will execute the request
The entire implementation of the interface is generated by Spring Feign
